https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a360620f28b82a711000047

You get any card as an argument. Your task is to return the suit of this card (in lowercase).

Our deck (is preloaded):

```angular2html
('3â™£') -> return 'clubs'
('3â™¦') -> return 'diamonds'
('3â™¥') -> return 'hearts'
('3â™ ') -> return 'spades'
```
